IMSI: unique international mobile sbuscriber identity

TMSI(Temporary Mobile subscriber indenties)
 In order to support the subscriber identity confidentiality service the VLRs, SGSNs and MMEs may allocate Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identities (TIMSI) to 
 visiting mobile subscribers. The VLR, SGSN, and MME must be capable of correlating an allocated TIMSI with the IMSI of the Mobile Station (MS) to which it is allocated.

An MS may be allocated three TMSIs, one for services provided through the MSC, one for services provided through the SGSN (P-TIMSI for short) and i
one for the services provided via the MME (M-TIMSI which is part of GUTI).

MSIN: Moblie subscriber identification number
    Mobile Country Code (MCC) consisting of three digits. The MSS identifies uniquely the country of domicile of mobile subscriber. 
    Mobile Network Code (MNC) consisting of two or three digits for GSM/UMTS applications.  That's why, if you are close to your country border UE is still using eNodeBs 
    that belongs/are controled by Mobile Operator from your country. In other words .. the MNC identifies the home PLMN of the mobile subscriber. The length of the MNC 
    (two or three digits) depends on the value of the MCC. A mixture of two and three digit MNC codes within a single MCC area is not recommended according to 3GPP specification.
    Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) identifying the mobile subscriber within a PLMN.

In Fig. 1. there is also shown NMSI entity. The National Mobile Subscriber Identity (NMSI) consists of the MNC and the NMSI.

this will be allocated to each mobile subsriber in every (GSM, UMTS and EPS)sytem.

Globally Unique MME Identifier (GUMMEI)
The format and size of the GUTI is:
GUTI = GUMMEI + M-TMSI, where
GUMMEI = MCC + MNC + MME Identifier and
MME Identifier = MME Group ID + MME Code
MCC and MNC shall have the same field size as in earlier 3GPP systems.
M-TMSI shall be of 32 bits length.
MME Group ID shall be of 16 bits length.
MME Code shall be of 8 bits length.




** Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity (GUTI )
The purporse of the GUTI is to provife an unambiguous identification of the UE that does not reveal the UE or the user's permanent identity in the Evolved Packet System
(EPS). It also allows the identification of the MME and network. It can be used by network and the UE to establish UE's identity during signaling between them in EPS.
On GUTI consist two main components:

    GUMMEI - that uniquely identifies the MME which has allocated the GUTI
    M-TMSI - other that uniquely identifies the UE within the MME because of allocated the GUTI

Because of that when UE is contacting the network it sends the GUTI to the eNodeB which then uses the GUTI number to identify to which MME re-establish request will be send.
If the UE has moved from UMTS cell to LTE cell, a TAU procedure is made (because UE does not have its GUTI) and P-TMSI is send. By this way MME, which is in control of
area to which UE moved to, can contact SGSN, which controlled area where UE was previously, to request the subscribers current profile like IP address and PDP contexts.
Situation is similiar when UE has moved from LTE to UMTS cell. GUTI is sent as the P-TMSI parameter and the procedure is reffered as Routing Area Update (RAU).
If there is a situation where eNodeB from new LTE cell is not associated with MME on which GUMMEI is pointing eNodeB simply will select new MME. The new MME 
could get context information from old MME using same GUTI.

* PDN, bearer and APN
** PDN concept
In that home, the APN comes into play inside the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) node of the core network.

Where You’ll See LTE APN

The HSS contains users’ SAE subscription data such as the EPS-subscribed Quality of Service (QoS) profile and any access restrictions for roaming. HSS also contains
information about the (Pocket Data Networks) PDNs to which the user can connect, as reported by Alcatel-Lucent. “This could be in the form of an access point name (APN) (which is a label according to DNS naming conventions describing thei
access point to the PDN) or a PDN address (indicating subscribed IP address(es)). In addition the HSS holds dynamic information such as the identity of the MME to which the user
is currently attached or registered. The HSS may also integrate the authentication center (AUC), which generates the vectors for authentication and security keys.” [1]

 What LTE APN Does

 To break it down, the APN identifies a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) or Packet Data Network GateWay (P-GW). It includes an APN network identifier which defines the Packet Data 
 Network (PDN) to which the UE requests connectivity, and may also include an APN operator identifier which defines in which Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) the P-GW or
 GGSN is located, according to LTE World. [2] To accomplish this, the APN structure is comprised into two parts: a network identifier and an operator identifier.

  How to identify?

  There are also steps for identifying a PDN IP network that the mobile data user wants to communicate with. The NMC Consulting Group notes that the PDN Identity (APN) is used to
  determine the P-GW and point of interconnection with a PDN. With APN as query parameter to the DNS procedures, the MME will receive a list of candidate P-GWs, and then a P-GW is 
  selected by MME with policy. [3]

  3GPP Views

  The board who sets the standards for 3GPP, however, sees things a little differently. According to the new standards puts in place, the UE shall not include APN and PCO in the 
  PDN connectivity request when the same is sent along with attach request. 3GPP has said that the UE shall send the PDN connectivity request with a flag “ESM Information transfer”
  on and no APN or PCO shall be included. Once the MME receives the Attach Request+PDN connectivity request, it can move ahead and accept the attach but it still cannot establish
  the EPS bearers just yet.
  Next, MME goes ahead with establishing security context. After the security context is established MME will send a NAS message “ESM Information Request” asking UE for APN and PCO. 
  Then, the UE will send an “ESM Information Response” with APN and PCO, encrypted. Finally, once MME receives this response it will go ahed with establishing the EPS bearers.
  If the response doesn’t include APN then default APN shall be used by MME.

*** EPS Session

IP connection between a UE and a PDN is called PDN connection or EPS session. Each PDN connection (or EPS session) is represented by an IP address of the UE and a PDN ID (in other words,
 Access Point Name (APN)). It has more than one EPS bearer to deliver user traffic (IP packets), and applies the service quality (QoS) policy obtained from a PCRF to the EPS bearers.
 The minimum fundamental bearer that an EPS session has for a PDN is called a default EPS bearer.

 
Having an EPS session established means 
i) a PDN through which a user is to use services has been selected (by the user’s input or based on the subscription information provisioned by an HSS), 
ii) an IP address to be used in the PDN has been assigned to the user, 
iii) policy rules to be applied to the user IP packets (QoS and charging rules) have been selected,
iv) a default EPS bearer for delivering IP packets over the LTE network has been established. 
Through this EPS session established, IP packets can be exchanged between the user and the PDN according to the rules set by the operator.

Management and operation of sessions, including PCRF, will be explained in other document, and a PDN ID (APN) will be discussed as an ID relating to the EPS session in this document.


*** EPS Bearer

An EPS session is in charge of delivering and handling flows of the IP packets that are labeled with UE IP addresses and travel between a UE and a PDN (UE – P-GW – PDN).
 On the other hand, an EPS bearer is a pipe through which IP packets are delivered over the LTE network, i.e., between a UE and a P-GW (UE – eNB – S-GW - P-GW).
 A UE can have multiple EPS bearers concurrently. So, different EPS bearers are identified by their EPS bearer ID, which is allocated by an MME.

As seen in Figure 1, an EPS bearer actually is a concatenation of the following three bearers (DRB, S1 bearer and S5 bearer):

    [UE] - [eNB]: Data Radio Bearer (DRB)

EPS bearer established over LTE-Uu interface. User traffic (IP packet) is delivered through a DRB. Different DRBs are identified by their DRB ID, which is allocated by an eNB.

    [eNB] - [S-GW]: S1 bearer

EPS bearer established over S1-U interface. User traffic is delivered through a GTP tunnel. Different S1 bearers are identified by their tunnel endpoint identifier (TEID), which is allocated by the endpoints (eNB and S-GW) of the GTP tunnel. 

    [S-GW] - [P-GW]: S5 bearer

EPS bearer established over S5 interface. User traffic is delivered through a GTP tunnel. Different S5 bearers are identified by their tunnel endpoint identifier (TEID), which is allocated by the endpoints (S-GW and P-GW) of the GTP tunnel.

*** Types of EPS Bearers
Before we go ahead and describe EPS bearer-related IDs, we will look at different types of EPS bearers and how they work. Figure 2 shows two different types of EPS bearers:
default and dedicated. Each PDN must have one default EPS bearer, but may have none to many dedicated EPS bearers.

The LTE network is an all-IP network, and provides its users with always-on IP connectivity. This means, once a UE connects to a PDN using the IP address assigned at its initial attach 
to the network, the IP connection remains connected after a default EPS bearer is established over the LTE network and until the UE detaches from the LTE network 
(i.e., the PDN connection is terminated). Even when there is no user traffic to send, the default EPS bearer always stays activated and ready for possible incoming user traffic.

Additional EPS bearer can be established if the default EPS bearer itself is not sufficient enough to obtain QoS (see LTE QoS document). The additional EPS bearer established 
is called a dedicated EPS bearer and multiple dedicated bearers can be created if required by the user or the network. When there is no user traffic, these dedicated EPS bearers 
can be removed, whereas the default one is never removed and keeps the user staying connected to the network unless the user detaches from the network. Dedicated EPS bearers are linked to
a default EPS bearer. The linked bearers are represented by a Linked EPS Bearer Identity (LBI), indicating they are all associated with the same default EPS bearer.


*** ID to identify PDN: PDN ID (APN)
PDNs are identified by PDN IDs (or Access Point Names (APNs)). An APN, as can be easily inferred, refers to an access point to a PDN where a user wishes to connect for services/applications.
APNs and their format are illustrated. An APN is a combination of a network ID and an operator ID. The network ID is used when identifying PDNs such as Internet or Corporate VPNs or 
identifying services like IMS that the PDN provides.
An APN is provisioned to an HSS as subscription information at the time of a user’s subscription (as in case 1 of Figure 3)2. Upon a UE’s initial attach, a default APN is 
downloaded from the HSS to an MME. The MME selects a PDN to connect the UE based on the APN first, and then a P-GW through which the UE is connected to the PDN . 
the MME selected PDN 1 based on APN 1, and then P-GW 1 for connection to PDN 1.

** Paging
Paging is from s1-release scenario
 ue: ECM=idle EMM=registered(guti,TAlist(TA1,TA2) in UE)

SGW get some data from the Internet, incoming donwlink data, sgw start to buffer them and request mme to estalbishment of E-RAB

SGW sent Downlink Data Notification(MME-TEID) to  mme
mme find subscirber with MME-TEID 

S-TMSI=MMEC+MTMSI 
S_TMSI is used to identify the subscirber

MME send Paging() to all the enbs(when s1-setup, enbs notify mme that its TAs) in the ta list(which is send to ue when attach accept).
enb1: own ip addr 13           enb2: ipaddr:12          mme: ipaddr:11
     Tal: Ta1, Ta2                  Tal: Ta2,Ta3              capacity: 25 


paging(S-TMSI,TA1+TA2)
-------------------------> enb1

paing(S-TMSI, TA2)
-------------------------> enb2
when ue recevied paing message from enb, it will send a service request nas messaeg to eNB


** detach procedure
detach procedure triggered by SIM card removed or cell phone is switched off.
The difference between detatch and s1-release is that detach will make SGW, MME, ENB delete all the ids it maintained for that SIM card.
while s1-release procedure is from enb(that lost connection with UE), so UE related info in ENB will be all removed, but SGW and MME may keep some info related only to UE 
other than related to enb.

after attach the ids in enb,mme,sgw
enb: enb-s1-id, mme-s1-id,      mme:imsi,enb-s1-id,mme-s1-id,                 sgw:imsi, mme-teid,

picture example: 
M means message() means parameter in message,[] means inteigiry protected message,{}means cyphered message 
A means Action. <> means stored [] means allocated

so after the attach, there are some value in the network element accordingly

ue: guti, tailist
enb: enb-s1-id, mme-s1-id, enb-teid, sgw-teid
sgw: imsi, mme-teid, sgw-teid, enb-teid
mme: ismi,enb-s1-id,mme-s1-id, guti, mme-teid, sgw-teid


note all the data packet won't pass mme, data only in sgw and enb(enb talk with  ue via radio network)
other components are connected via real nettwork(core net work?) 
mme will only control the ue's guti and talist.
talist is the tas which not needed to do TAU for ue, if ue entered another tas not in talist, ue will perform TAU to mme,
mme will get updated where ue is










** Tracking Area Update
this procedure and be initiated by UE or just periodic.

*** UE initiated TAU 
When an UE detects it has entered a new Tracking Area(that is not in the list of TAIS when attach Accept),
it initiates a standalone tracking area update procedure.
**** ECM=IDLE ACTIVE FLAG = OFF
If the UE(in idle mode)has no UpLink data pending, it will initiate TAU with active_flag off

**** ECM=IDLE ACTIVE FLAG = ON

*** periodic TAU
In addition, an EMM-REGISTERED and ECM-IDLE state UE performs periodic Tracking Area Update with the network after the expiry of the periodic TAU timer (T3412).
The value of timer is sent by the network to the UE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message (and can be sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message). Periodic tracking area 
updateing is used to periodically notify the availability of the EMM-IDLE state UE to the network. 

** Handover procedure
When a UE has connection to an eNB(through some cell), it is constantly measuring the signal strenths of all the
cell around it.
UE  EMM=registered ECM=connected
while UE is moving, it notices that a new cell is having a significantly stronger signal
than the current cell,then UE will send a Measurement Report to the source eNB
about the event
When source eNB receives the Measurment report it'll make a decision about performing a handover

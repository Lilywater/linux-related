how to connect all the hosts all over the world?
through network, what connected network, router/gateway or bridged
we focus on router, which is connected in the network layer.
ip protocol not guarantee all the packed delvied to the end-user. It 
make all the effort to deliver as much packets as it can.
If error, there will be an icmp packet to tell the sender in ip layer.
All routers will forward the packet if the destination is not itself.

A. the host is not itself or the broadcast address (upper protocol stack)
B. the network is not itself(hosts connected directly with it)
C. default
.....
netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway        Genmask        Flags  MSS Window irrt  Iface
0.0.0.0        10.121.122.1   0.0.0.0         UG    0    0       0    eth0
10.121.122.0   0.0.0.0      255.255.255.128    U    0    0       0    eth0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
U: useable
G: gateway
H: host

But there will be a problem, the ip packet will be transfered in the network
forever, if there's no proper route.
So TTL(time to live) in routers, this value will be decreased in every next hop router which the packet will pass by
if TTL is 1 in a router, there will be a icmp(time-to-live exceeded) to report error

* How long will be a pcket?
** limitaions on three layers
1.data link layer: there's on lenght field for the erthenet frame, in the slip
there's no even slip header for the packet at all, but there's a limit on the packet on the network, MTU, the is the hardware limitation.
netstat -in
Iface   MTU
eth0    1500
lo      16436

2. network layer
ip packet length: 16bit, 2 bytes.(maximum ip packet length is 65535)
So even no hardware limitation, the network layer has a limitation that a
single packet could only be 65535 plus ethernet header length

3. transmission layer
tcp has no length field for all the tcp length


** framgmetation
if a packet from the trasmission layer is too long, it needed to be devided
into small pieces, there's a fragment flag in the IP header,
Don't frament , more fragments
13 bit frament offset:

** TOS
type of the service 


**Identification 
16 bit,  for this single ip packet

** protocol
for the upper protocol stack,
tcp/udp/sctp

** broadcast ip address
the network+host(whole 1) is the broadcast ip
for example

  IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.121.122.20
  Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.128

so the broadcast addr is 10.121.122.127
when the ip addr is 10.121.122.127, the ethernet addr is ff:ff:ff:ff
and it will go across all the hosts in the subnetwork,
 

MSS the longest packet length for tcp packet
IN SYN phase, each endpoint will tell the peer its nown packet length.
MSS is limited to the outlet interface's MTU value.
